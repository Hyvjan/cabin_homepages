"Welcome to Lapland. This website offers a fantastic holiday destination in "
"the far north of Finland. Built in 2006, to a bold architectural design – it "
"is located next to one of the premier ski resorts inside the arctic circle.\n"
"The Villa can accommodate up to 8 + 2 people in absolute luxury. Within easy "
"reach of the airport, and with the option of having all the hassle catering "
"and cleaning taken care of – you can relax; enjoy the snow, and entertain in "
"style. Whatever the reason the Kaunisvilla offers all you could ask from "
"your stay in Lapland..\n"
"<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"So..please feel welcome to look around – and if you like what you see, then "
"get in touch – and book yourself a slice of Arctic heaven!\n"

"The Kaunisvilla (Kaunis=Pretty in Finnish) is owned in partnership by two "
"Finnish Families. Like most Finns – they know how to enjoy winter sports, "
"and frozen landscapes. It has been their ultimate dream to build this lodge. "
"It has taken many years of careful planning, research to find the site, and "
"significant financial outlay to realise their dream.\n"
"<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"The owners always reserve a few weeks every year to spend at the lodge – and "
"ensure that the accommodation meets their highest expectation.\n"
"<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"When you book time at the Kaunisvilla – all your hosting requirements – from "
"the collection at the airport – to the cuisine and friendly domestic service "
"– will be handled by local Lapland guides.\n"
"<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"But the booking – and contact through this site- is all handled by the "
"owners, and you can be assured that you are dealing with committed, "
"knowledgeable people, who place the highest value in making your stay – "
"simply the best.\n"
